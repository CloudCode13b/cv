    <h2><strong>My Work Experience</strong></h2>
    <h3>★<strong>U.S. Army</strong>★</h3>
    <p><em>I am a proud U.S. Army veteran with 12 years in service. I have served on
        2 overseas deployments. First, I was in Afghanistan, where I served as
        an advisor to the Afghan National Army. For my second deployment I served in Bahrain
        in a base security role. I joined the Army on a whim because my home burned down,
        I had no place to go, and I couldn't afford to go to school. This may sound
        like a very sad story, but it isn't. In the Army I found a family and learned
        many life lessons. I commend those who retire from the armed forces and I
        considered that for myself, but the overseas tours and months training in the desert
        stateside kept me away from home more than I would like for the pay.</em></p>

    <h3><strong>Education Experience</strong></h3>
    <p><em>I have 2 years of experience working in education. I first worked in
        an alternative K-5 setting as a behavioral specialist. I also worked as a
        teachers assistant in the Exceptional Childrens (Special Education) department
        in an inner city middle school. I enjoyed teaching and helping students very much,
        but the pay is not enough for my family. I hope that I will have the chance to
        teach coworkers in the future!</em></p>

    <h3><em>Manufacturing</em></h3>
    <p>I have 3 years of experience in manufacturing, specifically furniture.
      I began as a quality inspector. My responsibilites extended far beyond simply
      the piece. I had played a vital role in the final part of the production system.
      I ensured that all of the fabrics, legs, arm covers, skirts, pillows, e.t.c.
      were accurate according to the codes that are found on the item production ticket.
      Afterwards I worked as a framebuilder. In this role I was required to memorize
      the process of assembling dozens of styles and types of furniture frames.
      I also trained other employees as a quality inspector and a framebuilder
      Both of these jobs were very physically and mentally intense, which I enjoyed,
      but the ceiling for income is low and their are dangerous health risks associated
      to working in that type of manufacturing environment long term.</p>
